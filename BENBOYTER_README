Canva Test Assumtions

InMemoryQueue
- Has a fixed size which can be changed via constructor
- Attempts to be FIFO
- Attempts to have reasonable performance

FileQueue
- Not required to be persistent between machine reboots
- Persistant between JVM restarts
- Performance across hundreds of JVM's and thousands of messages not a requirement (its rather slow)

SQSQueue
- Not a real implementation
- I don't think this will work in the real word, but not much would be required to make it work
- Few unit tests, would move to integration tests for this

UnitTests
- Avoided mocking where possible
